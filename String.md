# What are strings?
In python, anything that you enclose between single or double quotation marks is considered a string. A string is essentially a sequence or array of textual data. Strings are used when working with Unicode characters. 
## Example
```python
name = "Harry"
print("Hello, " + name)
```
## Output
Hello, Harry

Note: It does not matter whether you enclose your strings in single or double quotes, the output remains the same. 

Sometimes, the user might need to put quotation marks in between the strings. Example, consider the sentence: He said, “I want to eat an apple”.

How will you print this statement in python?: 
```He said, "I want to eat an apple".```
We will definitely use single quotes for our convenience
```python
print('He said, "I want to eat an apple".')
```

## Multiline Strings
If our string has multiple lines, we can create them like this: 
```python 
a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""
print(a)
```

## Accessing Characters of a String
In Python, string is like an array of characters. We can access parts of string by using its index which starts from 0.\
Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.

```python 
print(name[0])
print(name[1])

```

## Looping through the string
We can loop through strings using a for loop like this: 
```python
for character in name:
    print(character)
```

Above code prints all the characters in the string name one by one!


# String Slicing & Operations on String
# Length of a String
We can find the length of a string using len() function.

## Example:
```python
fruit = "Mango"
len1 = len(fruit)
print("Mango is a", len1, "letter word.")
```
## Output:
Mango is a 5 letter word.
# String as an array
A string is essentially a sequence of characters also called an array. Thus we can access the elements of this array. 

## Example:
```python
pie = "ApplePie"
print(pie[:5])
print(pie[6])	#returns character at specified index
```
## Output:
```
Apple
i
```
 

Note: This method of specifying the start and end index to specify a part of a string is called slicing. 
## Slicing Example:
```python
pie = "ApplePie"
print(pie[:5])      #Slicing from Start
print(pie[5:])      #Slicing till End
print(pie[2:6])     #Slicing in between
print(pie[-8:])     #Slicing using negative index
```
## Output:
```
Apple
Pie
pleP
ApplePie
```
# Loop through a String:
Strings are arrays and arrays are iterable. Thus we can loop through strings.
## Example:
```python
alphabets = "ABCDE"
for i in alphabets:
    print(i)
  ```
## Output:
```
A
B
C
D
E
```
# Docstrings in python
Python docstrings are the string literals that appear right after the definition of a function, method, class, or module. 
## Example
```python
def square(n):
    '''Takes in a number n, returns the square of n'''
    print(n**2)
square(5)

```
Here, 

'''Takes in a number n, returns the square of n''' 
is a docstring which will not appear in output

## Output:
```
25
```
Here is another example:
```python
def add(num1, num2):
    """
    Add up two integer numbers.

    This function simply wraps the ``+`` operator, and does not
    do anything interesting, except for illustrating what
    the docstring of a very simple function looks like.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num1 : int
        First number to add.
    num2 : int
        Second number to add.

    Returns
    -------
    int
        The sum of ``num1`` and ``num2``.

    See Also
    --------
    subtract : Subtract one integer from another.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> add(2, 2)
    4
    >>> add(25, 0)
    25
    >>> add(10, -10)
    0
    """
    return num1 + num2
```
## Python Comments vs Docstrings
### Python Comments

Comments are descriptions that help programmers better understand the intent and functionality of the program. They are completely ignored by the Python interpreter.
### Python docstrings

As mentioned above, Python docstrings are strings used right after the definition of a function, method, class, or module (like in Example 1). They are used to document our code.

We can access these docstrings using the __doc__ attribute.
## Python __doc__ attribute
Whenever string literals are present just after the definition of a function, module, class or method, they are associated with the object as their __doc__ attribute. We can later use this attribute to retrieve this docstring.

## Example
```python
def square(n):
    '''Takes in a number n, returns the square of n'''
    return n**2

print(square.__doc__)
```
## Output:
Takes in a number n, returns the square of n

# String formatting in python
String formatting can be done in python using the format method.
```python
txt = "For only {price:.2f} dollars!"
print(txt.format(price = 49))
```
# f-strings in python
It is a new string formatting mechanism introduced by the PEP 498. It is also known as Literal String Interpolation or more commonly as F-strings (f character preceding the string literal). The primary focus of this mechanism is to make the interpolation easier.

When we prefix the string with the letter 'f', the string becomes the f-string itself. The f-string can be formatted in much same as the str.format() method. The f-string offers a convenient way to embed Python expression inside string literals for formatting.

## Example
```python
val = 'Geeks'  
print(f"{val}for{val} is a portal for {val}.")  
name = 'Tushar'  
age = 23  
print(f"Hello, My name is {name} and I'm {age} years old.")  
```
## Output:
```
Hello, My name is Tushar and I'm 23 years old.
```
In the above code, we have used the f-string to format the string. It evaluates at runtime; we can put all valid Python expressions in them.

We can use it in a single statement as well.
## Example
```python
print(f"{2 * 30})"  
```
## Output:
```
60
```

# String methods
Python provides a set of built-in methods that we can use to alter and modify the strings.


## upper() :
The upper() method converts a string to upper case.

### Example:
```python
str1 = "AbcDEfghIJ"
print(str1.upper())
```
### Output:
```
ABCDEFGHIJ
 ```

## lower()
The lower() method converts a string to lower case.
### Example:
```python
str1 = "AbcDEfghIJ"
print(str1.lower())
```
### Output:
```
abcdefghij
 ```

## strip() :
The strip() method removes any white spaces before and after the string.
### Example:
```python
str2 = " Silver Spoon "
print(str2.strip)
```
### Output:
```
Silver Spoon
``` 

## rstrip() : 
the rstrip() removes any trailing characters.
Example:
```python
str3 = "Hello !!!"
print(str3.rstrip("!"))
```
### Output:
```
Hello
 ```

## replace() : 
The replace() method replaces all occurences of a string with another string.
Example:
```python
str2 = "Silver Spoon"
print(str2.replace("Sp", "M"))
```
### Output:
```
Silver Moon
 ```

## split() :
The split() method splits the given string at the specified instance and returns the separated strings as list items.
### Example:
```python
str2 = "Silver Spoon"
print(str2.split(" "))      #Splits the string at the whitespace " ".
```
### Output:
```
['Silver', 'Spoon']
There are various other string methods that we can use to modify our strings.
```
 

## capitalize() : 
The capitalize() method turns only the first character of the string to uppercase and the rest other characters of the string are turned to lowercase. The string has no effect if the first character is already uppercase.
### Example:
```python
str1 = "hello"
capStr1 = str1.capitalize()
print(capStr1)
str2 = "hello WorlD"
capStr2 = str2.capitalize()
print(capStr2)
```
### Output:
```
Hello
Hello world
```

## center() : 
The center() method aligns the string to the center as per the parameters given by the user.
### Example:
```python
str1 = "Welcome to the Console!!!"
print(str1.center(50))
```
### Output:
```
            Welcome to the Console!!!
 ```

We can also provide padding character. It will fill the rest of the fill characters provided by the user.

### Example:
```python
str1 = "Welcome to the Console!!!"
print(str1.center(50, "."))
```
### Output:
```
............Welcome to the Console!!!.............
 ```

## count() :
The count() method returns the number of times the given value has occurred within the given string.
### Example:
```python
str2 = "Abracadabra"
countStr = str2.count("a")
print(countStr)
```
### Output:
```
4
```
 

## endswith() : 
The endswith() method checks if the string ends with a given value. If yes then return True, else return False. 
### Example :
```python
str1 = "Welcome to the Console !!!"
print(str1.endswith("!!!"))
```
### Output:
```
True
```
We can even also check for a value in-between the string by providing start and end index positions.

### Example:
```python
str1 = "Welcome to the Console !!!"
print(str1.endswith("to", 4, 10))
```
### Output:
```
True
 ```

## find() : 
The find() method searches for the first occurrence of the given value and returns the index where it is present. If given value is absent from the string then return -1.
### Example:
```python
str1 = "He's name is Dan. He is an honest man."
print(str1.find("is"))
```
### Output:
```
10
 ```

As we can see, this method is somewhat similar to the index() method. The major difference being that index() raises an exception if value is absent whereas find() does not.

### Example:
```python
str1 = "He's name is Dan. He is an honest man."
print(str1.find("Daniel"))
```
### Output:
```
-1
 ```

## index() :
The index() method searches for the first occurrence of the given value and returns the index where it is present. If given value is absent from the string then raise an exception.
### Example:
```python
str1 = "He's name is Dan. Dan is an honest man."
print(str1.index("Dan"))
```
### Output:
```
13
 ```

As we can see, this method is somewhat similar to the find() method. The major difference being that index() raises an exception if value is absent whereas find() does not.

### Example:
```python
str1 = "He's name is Dan. Dan is an honest man."
print(str1.index("Daniel"))
```
### Output:
```
ValueError: substring not found
 ```

## isalnum() :
The isalnum() method returns True only if the entire string only consists of A-Z, a-z, 0-9. If any other characters or punctuations are present, then it returns False.
### Example 1:
```python
str1 = "WelcomeToTheConsole"
print(str1.isalnum())
```
Output:
```
True
 ```
## isalpha() :
The isalnum() method returns True only if the entire string only consists of A-Z, a-z. If any other characters or punctuations or numbers(0-9) are present, then it returns False.
### Example :
```python
str1 = "Welcome"
print(str1.isalpha())
```
### Output:
```
True
 ```

## islower() :
The islower() method returns True if all the characters in the string are lower case, else it returns False. 
### Example:
```python
str1 = "hello world"
print(str1.islower())
```
### Output:
```
True
 ```

## isprintable() :
The isprintable() method returns True if all the values within the given string are printable, if not, then return False.
### Example :
```python
str1 = "We wish you a Merry Christmas"
print(str1.isprintable())
```
### Output:
```
True
 ```
## isspace() :
The isspace() method returns True only and only if the string contains white spaces, else returns False.
### Example:
```python
str1 = "        "       #using Spacebar
print(str1.isspace())
str2 = "        "       #using Tab
print(str2.isspace())
```
### Output:
```
True
True
 ```

## istitle() : 
The istitile() returns True only if the first letter of each word of the string is capitalized, else it returns False.
### Example:
```python
str1 = "World Health Organization" 
print(str1.istitle())
```
### Output:
```
True
 ```

### Example:
```python
str2 = "To kill a Mocking bird"
print(str2.istitle())
```
### Output:
```
False
 ```

## isupper() :
The isupper() method returns True if all the characters in the string are upper case, else it returns False. 
### Example :
```python
str1 = "WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION" 
print(str1.isupper())
```
### Output:
```
True
 ```
  

## startswith() :
The endswith() method checks if the string starts with a given value. If yes then return True, else return False. 
### Example :
```python
str1 = "Python is a Interpreted Language" 
print(str1.startswith("Python"))
```
### Output:
```
True
 ```

## swapcase() : 
The swapcase() method changes the character casing of the string. Upper case are converted to lower case and lower case to upper case.
### Example:
```python
str1 = "Python is a Interpreted Language" 
print(str1.swapcase())
```
### Output:
```
pYTHON IS A iNTERPRETED lANGUAGE
 ```

### title() :
The title() method capitalizes each letter of the word within the string.
### Example:
```python
str1 = "He's name is Dan. Dan is an honest man."
print(str1.title())
```
### Output:
```
He'S Name Is Dan. Dan Is An Honest Man.
```
